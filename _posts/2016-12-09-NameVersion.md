title: Help us test Sming and win a reward
---

In preparation for the next version we are trying to make sure that all samples in the latest version of [Sming](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming) are working as expected. 
We have already checked some of them on a real ESP8266 device,  but there are still a lot of samples that are not tested. 
If you help us test them, report issues with the samples or even fix broken samples you will be eligible for a reward. 
The reward this time is naming the next version of Sming based on your nick name. If, for example, your nick name is `avr10` our next version can be names like `avrius tenius` :).

The list of samples is [here](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming/issues/800) and those that have :question: in their status should be tested.

Good luck and hopefully with your help we will be able to release a great new version of Sming before X-Mas.
