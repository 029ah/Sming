title: Sming 3.0.0 (X-mas) is officially released
---
We are having a fantastic Christmas release full of new features, performance and stability improvements. 
 
Let's mention a small part of them:
* Better handling of third-party libraries. Sming is using code from other open source projects. Getting the latest version of that code used to be time consuming and error-prone process. In this version that is no longer the case. We can have the latest version of Spiffs, rBoot, axTLS, Esp-Gdbstub or Stefan Bruens PWM in seconds.
* SSL support based on axTLS v2.1+. You can now send HTTP, MQTT or Websocket messages over SSL. This means that your small devices can securely report the temperature to a remote server. 
* Better fatal error reporting and support for custom crash handlers.
* Improved WebSocket support.
* Optional use of Stefan Bruens high-quality PWM library (as a drop-in replacement for the Espressif's one)
* Optional use of Umm-Malloc heap allocation for better usage of the available heap memory and prevention against heap fragmentation problems.
* Faster SPI.
* And many small or big bug-fixes, performance and stability improvements.  

For a complete list of changes run the following command:

```
git log 2.1.5..3.0.0
```

Thanks to all of you that contributed to this fantastic major release and ... 
Merry Christmas everyone!
