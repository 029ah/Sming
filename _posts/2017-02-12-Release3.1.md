title: Sming 3.1.0  is officially released
---
We are having an awesome new release full of major changes, new drivers and bugfixes.. 
 
Let's mention a small part of them:

## Major Changes
- Switched to using the open-source code of LWIP. This means more free heap and possibility to adapt the LWIP settings according to your network setup
- Added support for SDK 2.0
- Refactored `HardwareSerial` for better responsiveness and speed. Allowed the use of UART1. 
- Added hooks that will allow extending OTA with signed ROMs and encrypted OTA. See [wiki](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming/wiki/Signed-OTA) for details.
- Better Spiffs mounting logic
- Initial support for [YeeLight smart WiFi bulbs](http://www.yeelight.com/en_US/product/wifi-led-c).
- Initial support for AM2321 I2C sensor support.

And much more. All merged PRs in this release can be seen from [here](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming/milestone/8?closed=1)

## Backwards-incompatible changes
* spiffs_mount_manual() is using the actual Flash address. Before that it was using the memory-mapped address. If you used this function you should recalculate the mounting address using this formula: `new_address = (old_address - 0x40200000)
* espconn_* functions are not enabled by default. If you are using them make sure to compile your application with `ENABLE_ESPCONN=1`.
* HardwareSerial - there is RX buffer but if a more complex buffering is desired it has to be implemented inside the callback delegate. Also the callbacks will not receive every single character that was types but the latest one and all unread characters can be read from the buffer.
* If you use esp-alt-sdk 1.4 you should [patch](https://github.com/kireevco/esp-alt-sdk/pull/30) it in order to be able to use custom LWIP. 
* With this version we officially support SDK 2.0 and 1.5. Support for 1.4 is removed.
