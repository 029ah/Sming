We have already checked some of them on a real ESP8266 device,  but there are still a lot of samples that are not tested. 
If you help us test them, report issues with the samples or even fix broken samples you will be eligible for a reward. 
The reward this time is naming the next version of Sming based on your nick name. If, for example, your nick name is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;avr10&lt;/code&gt; our next version can be names like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;avrius tenius&lt;/code&gt; :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of samples is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming/issues/800&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and those that have :question: in their status should be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck and hopefully with your help we will be able to release a great new version of Sming before X-Mas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">In preparation for the next version we are trying to make sure that all samples in the latest version of Sming are working as expected.
