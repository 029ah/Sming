We have already checked some of them on a real ESP8266 device,  but there are still a lot of samples that are not tested.

The reward this time is naming the next version of Sming based on your nick name. If, for example, your nick name is avr10 our next version can be names like avrius tenius :).

    <p>In preparation for the next version we are trying to make sure that all samples in the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming">Sming</a> are working as expected. 
We have already checked some of them on a real ESP8266 device,  but there are still a lot of samples that are not tested. 
If you help us test them, report issues with the samples or even fix broken samples you will be eligible for a reward. 
The reward this time is naming the next version of Sming based on your nick name. If, for example, your nick name is <code class="highlighter-rouge">avr10</code> our next version can be names like <code class="highlighter-rouge">avrius tenius</code> :).</p>

<p>The list of samples is <a href="https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming/issues/800">here</a> and those that have :question: in their status should be tested.</p>

<p>Good luck and hopefully with your help we will be able to release a great new version of Sming before X-Mas.</p>
